### **General info:**
This project is an implementation of minimizing math functions using different methods.
<br/>
<br/>

### **Setup:**
Unfortunaltely only AUTH members can practically use this implementation. This is becasue of the fact that, in order to run the program, you have to include the 
correct *.jar* file within your project that it is on the following link. The problem is that you need to be AUTH student to enter the platform.<br/>

*This section will be filled with more useful info soon*.
